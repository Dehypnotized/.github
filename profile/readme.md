### TECH 
using **data crawlers** and **community contributions**


### Self-living concept

##### The platform is sustained by its native cryptocurrency, XSO.

Community contributions allow the platform to gain content and teach ML based on all the content from the project. Contributors gaining tokens to convert them to the AI requests API

# BLOCKCHAIN OVERVIEW

- **Crawlers:** Web crawlers are designed to scrape different websites and gather
  data for ML training. These are open-sourced, allowing the community to develop
  and contribute to them. Crawlers can be compiled into WebAssembly and stored
  on IPFS.
- **Data Preprocessing Engines:** Custom blockchain nodes execute these engines,
  which prepare and clean the collected data for AI training. This includes tasks
  such as normalization, handling missing data, and encoding categorical variables.
- **AI Training:** The AI training process is decentralized across custom blockchain
  nodes, which use preprocessed data to train ML models. This training can use
  federated learning or similar decentralized approaches.
- **AI Models:** The primary AI model is based on architectures like RoBERTa or GPT
  and is extended with child ML models trained using the collected data. These
  models are stored on IPFS and updated with each mined block.
- **Console Application:** A console application is developed for interaction with the
  AI model. Users can ask questions, hold discussions, and execute code or scripts
  based on user input demands.

### DETAILED PROJECT ROAD

- Project Initialization: Define project scope and
  requirements, set up the development environment, and
  establish the Agile process.
- Implement Basic Crawlers: Design and develop the initial
  data collection tools, implement data storage on IPFS, and
  ensure quality assurance.

**Project Setup & Initial Development**

- Custom Blockchain Development: Define requirements,
  design blockchain architecture, and implement basic
  blockchain features.
- Integration of ML Processes into Blockchain: Design and
  implement the integration of ML processes with the
  blockchain, and test this integration.

**Blockchain Development**

- Data Preprocessing: Design and implement data
  preprocessing pipelines, including data cleaning,
  transformation, and feature engineering.
- Parent-Child ML Model Development: Design the
  architecture for parent-child ML models train initial models,
  evaluate performance, and iterate for improvements.

**Machine Learning Development**

- Integration of AI Models with Application: Develop the
  a console application, integrate AI models, and implement
  code/script execution features.
- Testing & Quality Assurance: Thorough testing of the
  the entire system, perform security audits and address bugs
  and issues.

**Final Integration & Testing**

- Crawler Enhancement & Community Involvement: Enhance
  crawlers with additional features, document and open-
  source them, and encourage community contributions.
- Scaling Data Collection & Processing: Optimize data
  collection for scale, implement distributed data processing,
  and optimize ML models for large-scale datasets.

**Integration & Scaling**

**-** Launch: Prepare for launch including final checks and
documentation, and launch the solution to the public.
- Ongoing Maintenance & Improvement: Monitor the
  the system, collect feedback, address issues, and continuously
  improve and update the system based on feedback and
  emerging technologies.

**Launch & Maintenance**


### TOKENOMICS MODEL

#### Token Utility

```
XSO tokens serve as an incentive mechanism, granting
access to AI models and data, participation in governance,
and network operations. Users can also stake tokens for
rewards.
```
#### Economic Model

```
XSO has a fixed supply of 1 billion. A deflationary
mechanism burns a small percentage of tokens used in
transactions, reducing the overall supply over time.
Rewards are given to data contributors, AI trainers,
and those who stake tokens. Tokens are also mined by
network participants.
```
#### Growth and Value Creation

```
The growth of the dAI platform and the increasing
demand for tokens due to their utility will create value
for contributors and incentivize participation in the
ecosystem.
```
#### Token Distribution

```
Tokens will be distributed in the following manner: Public Sale
(40%), Private Sales (10%), Team and Advisors (15%), Community
Fund (15%), Development Fund (10%), Staking Rewards and
Mining (10%). A reserve pool of tokens is also maintained for
future needs.
```

##### Native Cryptocurrency

```
Issue XSO, reward contributors,
and enable token trading on
exchanges.
```
##### Data Market

```
A data market can be established
within the platform where users
can buy and sell datasets.
```
##### Blockchain Nodes

```
Transaction fees are charged for the use
of the network. Third-party entities can
also pay to deploy their nodes.
```
##### Premium Services

```
Advanced AI training tools, resources, and
services can be offered for a fee to users
and enterprises.
```
